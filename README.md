# Used Car Prices

**Intro** - As many people accross the world do, I recently had to purchase a car. Deciding on a used vehicle, made me realize just how difficult it can be to find the right car. There are so many ways to find used cars and with new websites coming out all the time to help sell cars, not only are vehicles tough to find, but the prices can significantly change depending on where you are looking to purchase the car. This project attempts to help determine a price of a used vehicle based on the dataset of many used car in Europe.

**Tools** - Python, R, Pandas, Numpy,

**Data** - Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/lepchenkov/usedcarscatalog

**Methods/Evaluation/Techniques** - Distributions, Machine learning, Model fitting

**Conclusion** - It is not very easy to determine a price of a used car based on the dataset. In data science, when using models, we are normally trying to get the same result. For example if we are trying to predict the number of wins of a team, there is very specific target of say 5 games. But for the price of a used car, it is hard to say exactly what the price should be as the number is very subjective. Using several different types of models and machine learning, fairly accuracte estimates within $1,000, $1,500, and $2,000 were found for used cars.
